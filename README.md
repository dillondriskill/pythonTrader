# Python Trader
An automated python based stock trading bot

Designed to be lightweight and relatively portable to be run on a Raspberry Pi Zero W

For this you will need the [TD Ameritrade Python API](https://github.com/areed1192/td-ameritrade-api)

This can be accomplished with pip:
> pip install td-ameritrade-python-api

[There are tutorials on how to use API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3YFZLeUoa8), made by the creator, Alex Reed of Sigma Coding. It is **HIGHLY** recommended that you watch these before trying to use this api, because it **WILL** confuse you.

And you will need a Td Ameritrade account as well as a developer account, which can be found [here](https://developer.tdameritrade.com)
